                            After discovering Kurimi ice cream, going to the 
                            other icecream places is my last resort. Even-
                            though the variety of ice cream are not as many 
                            as the other more commercial brands but the 
                            quality of their icecreams are second to none.

                            I love Kurimi ice-cream very much! it does not taste
artificial at all, we ordered their best seller; Raebry
and Whitermel, both of them is amazingly good,
sweetness is also good

                            I tried the matcha and el coco since it’s very unique
                            and interesting, turns out the taste is so balanced
                            with each other and the garnish is also very non-
                            artificial. 10/10. Good customer service too.

                            Personally for me it is just too sweet, maybe because
I am not a fan of sweets, but overall the staffs are
all very welcoming and friendly, made me enjoy
to eat though I don’t enjoy eating sweets.

                            Staffs are all very friendly, the ice creams are 
amazing, we tried 4 different flavors, but the down-
side was the ice cream was taking too long, maybe
due to too many people at the moment.

                            brand, ice cream’s level is on top and staffs were all

Whitermel the most, the ice cream was not too

and taking quite long to come.

                            Came at their first day of grand opening, it was hectic
and crowded as hell, but overall I enjoyed my
experience there, though the staffs were all very
tired, they still welcome me with a huge smile :)

                            Wished there were more options, maybe because
they just opened, I tried Fairy, and holy!! it was
very good, the combination is so perfect, I thought
it would be too sweet.

                            Came to Singapore just to try this, and it worth every
peny, I could literally eat this for a week straight,
price was okay, staffs were friendly, Raebry is good,
Chuyu is my favourite so far.
