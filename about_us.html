                Due to her extreme fondness for ice cream, she decided to launch a 
                pre-order for her friends to taste her new and unusual ice cream recipe. 
                It transpired that her friends adored it and pushed her to start her own
                little company. She began her business on a modest scale, continued to get 
                chances to collaborate with major companies, and was able to boost her 
                sales within days before opening her first shop. It was a trip on a roller coaster, 
                and things were not always rainbows, but I realised that nothing is impossible 
                if you apply your whole focus and energy. 
                <br><br>
                This ice cream business was founded with the purpose of not only selling
                ice cream <br> but also promoting local farmers and goods. We aim to guarantee 
                that the vast <br> majority of our products  originate from Indonesia and are of the best quality. <br> 
                In addition, 
                none of our products include any artificial flavours
                or colourings. <br> On top of it, to make it unique, we
                also added several topping and <br> syrup to make
                your ice cream game more exciting, and our very <br>
                famous waffle cone is also made freshly everyday
                for the extra crunch. <br> <br>
                
                Making it less-sweet is also a very important
                aspect for us since we know <br> that too much sugar
                does not have any benefit to our health, hence we <br>
                made it less-sugar and using the finest sugar to
                bring out the best flavors. <br> <br>
                
                Now with around 23 stores operating around
                Indonesia, Malaysia, and <br> Singapore, we hope we
                could come and say hi to those countries that <br>
                we have not yet to open.
